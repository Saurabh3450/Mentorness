# Mentorness Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my internship at Mentorness, where I worked on two data analysis projects: Walmart Sales Analysis and Analysis of Food and Beverage Industry Survey Data. Each project involved deriving meaningful insights using SQL and Power BI.

## Projects Overview
